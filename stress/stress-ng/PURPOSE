Run stress-ng tests
  git://kernel.ubuntu.com/cking/stress-ng.git

Note: The timeout is per stressor, not the whole class.
Run 'stress-ng --class interrupt?' to see all the stressors
in the interrupt class.  Multiply the number of stressors
by the timeout to get the expected run time.

As of the V0.09.56 release, there are 289 total stressors in
the 5 classes interrupt, cpu, cpu-cache, memory, and os, so
the expected runtime is 144.5 minutes with a 30 sec timeout.
